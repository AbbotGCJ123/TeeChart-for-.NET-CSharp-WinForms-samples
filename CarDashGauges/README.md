TeeChart for .NET demo - Subaru BRZ acceleration simulation
===========================================================

The example uses TeeChart's Circular and Numeric Gauges to simulate the acceleration of a 2013 Subaru BRZ car.

This is a simulation only and though the basis is fairly faithful to empirical results it does not make claims to authenticity.

To compile this demo you need the TeeChart assembly, teechart.dll. The evaluation version can be downloaded via the evaluation version page:
